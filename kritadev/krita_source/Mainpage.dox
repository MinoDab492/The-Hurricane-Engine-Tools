/**
  \mainpage Krita Painting application

  Krita is an advanced and modular painting application.

  Krita is built around two core libraries: pigment and kritaimage.

  The pigment library abstracts colorspaces and color
  transformations. ColorSpaces provide functions to manipulate pixels. The
  kritcolor library loads colorspace plugins to extend the range of
  available colorspaces.

  The kritaimage library abstracts the storage, creation, inspection
  and manipulation of pixels stored in a rectangular area. It provides
  layers, filters, iterators and painters. Filters and paint operations
  are provided as service plugins loaded through the appropriate trader
  queries.

  There are the following types of plugins

<ul>
  <li> filters
  <li> generators
  <li> tools
  <li> brush engines
  <li> colorspaces
  <li> import/export filters
  <li> view plugins: plugins that extend krita with dockers, dialogs etcetera
</ul>
