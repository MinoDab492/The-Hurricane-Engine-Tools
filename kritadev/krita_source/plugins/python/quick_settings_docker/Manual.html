<h1 id="quick-settings-docker">Quick Settings Docker</h1>
<p>A Docker that allows you to quickly set the opacity, flow and size from a predefined list.</p>
<h2 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h2>
<p>Go to <strong>Settings → Docker → Quick Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, when you have a document open, and a brush selected, select any of the entries to change them. The docker doesn’t update when changing brush size any other way, to it will always show the last selected change.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Size</dt>
<dd>Change the brush diameter. For sketch and spray brushes, this changes the area of effect.
</dd>
<dt>Opacity</dt>
<dd>Change the brush opacity.
</dd>
<dt>Flow</dt>
<dd>Change the brush flow. This only works for brushes that support and use the ‘wash’ mode. For example, the Quick brush doesn’t support that, so it won’t change there.
