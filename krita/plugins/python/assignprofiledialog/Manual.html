<h1 id="assign-profile-to-image">Assign Profile To Image</h1>
<p>This allows you to assign a profile to an image instead of converting it to that profile.</p>
<p>The difference is that it allows only interpreting the colors by the new profile, but not change any of the values.</p>
<p>It can be found in <strong>Tools → Assign Profile To Image</strong></p>
<p>It will present a list of profiles for the current image’s color model(As changing color model or bit depth will require conversion).</p>
<p>Press OK and the pixels will be interpreted differently.</p>
