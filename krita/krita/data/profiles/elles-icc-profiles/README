To the best of my knowledge, all profiles included in the "Elle Stone's Well behaved Profiles" pack are free from known copyright restrictions. I am not a lawyer.

All nominally "Gamma=2.2" profiles have a gamma=2.19921875 TRC, in keeping with the gamma value used in nominally "gamma=2.2" V2 profiles. This gamma value reflects hexadecimal rounding that was unavoidable in V2 profiles.

All nominally "Gamma=1.8" profiles have a gamma=1.80078125 TRC, in keeping with the gamma value used in nominally "gamma=1.8" V2 profiles. This gamma value reflects hexadecimal rounding that was unavoidable in V2 profiles.

All the RGB and Gray profiles are provided in V2 and V4 versions, using their "normal" tone reproduction curve, plus variants with the sRGB TRC and the linear gamma TRC.

Profiles included:

1. AdobeRGB; to avoid copyright infringement issues, I used "ClayRGB" (following ArgyllCMS) as the base name for these profiles.

2. AllColorsRGB; this profile's color gamut is roughly the same size and shape as the ACES color gamut, but AllColorsRGB has a slightly larger color gamut and uses the D50 white point.

3. CIERGB

4. IdentityRGB

5. Prophoto/Romm; to avoid possible copyright infringement issues, I used "LargeRGB" (following RawTherapee) as the base name for these profiles.

6. sRGB

7. WideGamutRGB; to avoid possible copyright infringement issues, I used "WideRGB" as the base name for these profiles.

8. Gray ICC profiles, D50 white point

9. LCMS built-in LAB and XYZ ICC profiles

Details about the supplied profiles and variants:

1. AdobeRGB, D65, Gamma=2.19921875

Profile variants:

Gamma=2.19921875:
	ClayRGB-elle-V4-g22.icc
	ClayRGB-elle-V2-g22.icc
	
Linear gamma:
	ClayRGB-elle-V4-g10.icc
	ClayRGB-elle-V2-g10.icc
	
sRGB TRC:
	ClayRGB-elle-V4-srgbtrc.icc
	ClayRGB-elle-V2-srgbtrc.icc

Notes:

The Adobe RGB 1998 color gamut covers a higher percentage of real-world greens than sRGB, but still doesn't include all printable greens, yellows, and cyans. 

When made using the Gamma=2.19921875 tone response curve, this profile can be used for 8-bit image editing if used with appropriate caution to avoid posterization. 

When made with the Gamma=2.19921875 tone response curve, this profile can be applied to DCF R98 camera-generated jpegs.

The linear gamma version should only be used for high bit depth image editing and shouldn't be applied to camera-generated jpegs.

Primaries and white point:

cmsCIExyYTRIPLE adobe_primaries = {
{0.6400, 0.3300, 1.0},
{0.2100, 0.7100, 1.0},
{0.1500, 0.0600, 1.0}
};
cmsCIExyYTRIPLE adobe_primaries_prequantized = {
{0.639996511, 0.329996864, 1.0},
{0.210005295, 0.710004866, 1.0},
{0.149997606, 0.060003644, 1.0}
};
primaries = adobe_primaries_prequantized;
whitepoint = d65_srgb_adobe_specs;


2. AllColorsRGB, D50, Gamma=1.00:

Profile variants:

Linear gamma:
	AllColorsRGB-elle-V4-g10.icc
	AllColorsRGB-elle-V2-g10.icc
	
sRGB TRC:
	AllColorsRGB-elle-V4-srgbtrc.icc
	AllColorsRGB-elle-V2-srgbtrc.icc

Notes:

For high bit depth image editing only.

AllColors.icc has a slightly larger color gamut than the ACES color space. It has a D50 white point and a linear gamma TRC. It holds all visible colors.

Just like the ACES color space, AllColors also holds a high percentage of imaginary colors. See http://ninedegreesbelow.com/photography/xyz-rgb.html#xyY for more information about imaginary colors.

AllColors primaries for red and blue were calculated from http://www.ledtuning.nl/cie.php
blue 375nm red 780nm, plus Y intercepts:
Color Wavelength (): 375 nm.
Spectral Locus coordinates: X:0.17451 Y:0.005182
Color Wavelength (): 780 nm.
Spectral Locus coordinates: X:0.734690265 Y:0.265309735
X1:0.17451 Y1:0.005182
X2:0.734690265 Y2:0.265309735
X3:0.00Y3:? Solve for Y3:
(0.265309735-0.005182)/(0.734690265-0.17451)=0.46436433279205221554=m
y=mx+b let x=0; y=b
Y1=0.005182=(0.46436433279205221554*0.17451)+b
b=0.005182-(0.46436433279205221554*0.17451)=-.07585421971554103213

Primaries and white point:

cmsCIExyYTRIPLE allcolors_primaries = 
{
{0.734690265,  0.265309735,  1.0},
{0.000000000,  1.000000000,  1.0},
{0.000000000, -.0758542197,  1.0}
}; 
whitepoint = d50_illuminant_specs;

3. The CIERGB profile, E white point:

Profile variants:

Gamma=2.19921875:
	CIERGB-elle-V4-g22.icc
	CIERGB-elle-V2-g22.icc

Linear gamma:
	CIERGB-elle-V4-g10.icc
	CIERGB-elle-V2-g10.icc

sRGB TRC:
	CIERGB-elle-V4-srgbtrc.icc
	CIERGB-elle-V2-srgbtrc.icc";

Notes:

For high bit depth image editing only.

The ASTM E white point is probably the right E white point to use when making the CIERGB color space profile. It's not clear to me what the correct CIERGB primaries really are. Lindbloom gives one set. The LCMS version 1 tutorial gives a different set. I asked a friend to ask an expert, who said the real primaries should be calculated from the spectral wavelengths, so I did.

This page explains what the CIE color space is:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931

These pages give the wavelengths:
http://hackipedia.org/Color%20space/pdf/CIE%20Color%20Space.pdf 
http://infocom.ing.uniroma1.it/~gaetano/texware/Full-How%20the%20CIE%201931%20Color-Matching%20Functions%20Were%20Derived%20from%20Wright-Guild%20Data.pdf

This page has resources for calculating xy values given a spectral color wavelength:
http://www.cvrl.org/cmfs.htm

This page does the calculations for you:
http://www.ledtuning.nl/cie.php

Plugging the wavelengths into the ledtuning website gives the following CIE RGB xy primaries:
700.0 nm has Spectral Locus coordinates: x:0.734690023  y:0.265309977
546.1 nm has Spectral Locus coordinates: x:0.2736747378 y:0.7174284409
435.8 nm has Spectral Locus coordinates: x:0.1665361196 y:0.0088826412

Primaries and white point:

cmsCIExyYTRIPLE cie_primaries_ledtuning = {
{0.7346900230, 0.2653099770, 1.0},
{0.2736747378, 0.7174284409, 1.0},
{0.1665361196, 0.0088826412, 1.0}
}
primaries = cie_primaries_ledtuning_prequantized;
whitepoint = e_astm;

This profile also hold all possible visible colors, but less efficiently than the AllColors profile.

Primaries and white point:

cmsCIExyYTRIPLE identity_primaries = {
{1.0, 0.0, 1.0},
{0.0, 1.0, 1.0},
{0.0, 0.0, 1.0}
};
whitepoint = d50_illuminant_specs;

	LargeRGB-elle-V2-g10.icc

Reference Input/Output Medium Metric RGB Color Encodings (RIMM/ROMM RGB)
Kevin E. Spaulding, Geoffrey J. Woolfe and Edward J. Giorgianni
Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, New York, U.S.A.

Above document is available at http://photo-lovers.org/pdf/color/romm.pdf

Kodak designed the Romm (ProPhoto) color gamut to include all printable and most real world colors. It includes some imaginary colors and excludes some of the real world blues and violet blues that can be captured by digital cameras. It also excludes some very saturated "camera-captured" yellows as interpreted by some camera matrix input profiles.

Primaries and white point:
cmsCIExyYTRIPLE romm_primaries = {
{0.7347, 0.2653, 1.0},
{0.1596, 0.8404, 1.0},
{0.0366, 0.0001, 1.0}
};
primaries = romm_primaries;
whitepoint = d50_romm_spec;


6. sRGB, D65, sRGB-trc:

Profile variants:

sRGB TRC:
	sRGB-elle-V4-srgbtrc.icc
	sRGB-elle-V2-srgbtrc.icc

Linear gamma:
	sRGB-elle-V4-g100.icc
	sRGB-elle-V2-g100.icc
	
Notes:

When made using the standard sRGB TRC, this sRGB profile can be applied to DCF R03 camera-generated jpegs and is an excellent color space for editing 8-bit images.

The linear gamma sRGB profile should only be used for high bit depth image editing.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srgb:
Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft designed sRGB to match the color gamut of consumer-grade CRTs from the 1990s and to be the standard color space for the world wide web.

Primaries and white point:

cmsCIExyYTRIPLE srgb_primaries = {
{0.6400, 0.3300, 1.0},
{0.3000, 0.6000, 1.0},
{0.1500, 0.0600, 1.0}
};
cmsCIExyYTRIPLE srgb_primaries_pre_quantized = {
{0.639998686, 0.330010138, 1.0},
{0.300003784, 0.600003357, 1.0},
{0.150002046, 0.059997204, 1.0}
};
primaries = srgb_primaries_pre_quantized;
whitepoint = d65_srgb_adobe_specs;

	WideRGB-elle-V2-g10.icc

sRGB TRC:
	WideRGB-elle-V4-srgbtrc.icc
	WideRGB-elle-V2-srgbtrc.icc


Notes:

For high bit depth image editing only.

WideGamutRGB was designed by Adobe to be a wide gamut color space that uses spectral colors as its primaries.

Pascale's primary values produce a profile that matches old V2 Widegamut profiles from Adobe and Canon:

{0.7347, 0.2653, 1.0},
{0.1152, 0.8264, 1.0},
{0.1566, 0.0177, 1.0}
};
primaries = widegamut_pascale_primaries;
whitepoint = d50_romm_spec;

Notes:

I don't think LCMS2 code makes a V2 XYZ profile.
